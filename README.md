# COMP551 : A3
Feedforward Neural Network on a variation of MNIST dataset. 
Each image contains two digits and a letter. 
If the letter is 'A' or 'a', the network should predict the sum of the two digits.
If the letter is 'M' or 'm', it should predict their product.
The data files are too large to upload here. 

## Dependencies
Numpy: '1.21.1'

## Running the Feedforward NN
